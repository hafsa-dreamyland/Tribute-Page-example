       <li><strong>1909</strong> - 22 April 1909: born in Turin, Italy.<br/>
 In her teenage years, she considered becoming a writer and admired Swedish writer Selma Lagerl√∂f, but after seeing a close family friend die of stomach cancer she decided to attend the University of Turin Medical School.
         While she was at the University of Turin, the neurohistologist Giuseppe Levi
         sparked her interest in the developing nervous system.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1936</strong> - She graduated <em>summa cum laude M.D.</em>
         Montalcini remained at the university as Levi's assistant, but her
         academic career was cut short by Benito Mussolini's 1938 <em>Manifesto of
         Race</em>.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1938</strong> - She loses her assistant position in the anatomy
         department after a 1938 law barring Jews from university positions was
         passed.

       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1946</strong> - Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research
         fellowship in the laboratory of Professor Viktor Hamburger at
         Washington University in St. Louis; he was interested in two of
         the articles Levi-Montalcini had published in foreign scientific journals.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1952</strong> - Levi-Montalcini did her most important work: isolating nerve
         growth factor (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that
         cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells.
       </li>
       <li><strong>1958</strong> - She was made a full professor.</li>
       <li>
         <strong>1962</strong> - She established a second laboratory in Rome and
         divided her time between there and St. Louis.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1963</strong> - Rita Levi-Montalcini became the first woman to receive the Max
         Weinstein Award (given by the United Cerebral Palsy Association)
         due to her significant contributions into neurological research.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1961/1969</strong> - She directed the Research Center of
         Neurobiology of the CNR (Rome).
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1969/1978</strong> - She directed the Laboratory of
         Cellular Biology (Rome).
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1977</strong> -  Rita Levi-Montalcini was appointed as director of the Institute
         of Cell Biology of the Italian National Council of Research in Rome.
         She later retired from that position in 1979, however continued to
         be involved as a guest professor.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>1986</strong> - She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology
         or Medicine jointly with colleague Stanley Cohen for the discovery of
         nerve growth factor (NGF). The two earned their Nobel Prizes for
         their research in to the nerve growth factor (NGF), the protein
         that causes cell growth due to stimulated nerve tissue.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>2002</strong> - Levi-Montalcini founded the European Brain
         Research Institute, and then served as its president.

       <li>
         <strong>1990s</strong> - She was one of the first scientists pointing
         out the importance of the mast cell in human pathology. In the same
         period (1993), she identified the endogenous compound
         <em>palmitoylethanolamide</em> as an important modulator of this cell.
         Understanding this mechanism initiated a new era of research into
         this compound which has resulted in more discoveries regarding its
         mechanisms and benefits, a far better understanding of the
         endocannabinoid system and new liposomal palmitoylethanolamide product
         formulations designed specifically for improved absorption and bioavailability.
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>2009</strong> - On 22 April 2009, she became the first Nobel
